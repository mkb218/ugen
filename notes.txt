all mutable params have to come in on channels!

remove universe, replace with ugen level params sent by sink and replicated upstream
- samplerate
- buffer size
- input and output channels

every ugen should have a name and an id number
inter-ugen channels are unbuffered

Needs null sink and null source ugens

smarter to pass around slices as buffers, buffers can get recycled. 

Serialize node graph and bringing up again

create pluggable portaudio and sdl sinks

mixer should have a configurable number of channels

i wonder if it makes sense to preallocate one buffer per ugen output channel in the recycler
